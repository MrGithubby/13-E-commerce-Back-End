# E-Commerce Back End

## Description
This repository provides the back-end functionality for an e-commerce site, tailored for inventory and product management. It’s designed for managers at internet retail companies to help them effectively manage and organize stock. The back-end system includes a database with models for **Products**, **Categories**, and **Tags**. Products can be categorized and tagged, making it easy to organize and filter inventory. This system allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each model, giving users full control over their inventory data.

## Features
- **Product Management**: Add, view, update, or delete products.
- **Category Organization**: Organize products by categories.
- **Tag Labeling**: Use tags to further organize and classify products.
- **CRUD Operations**: Full support for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests on all models.

## Setup & Usage
1. **Initialize the Database**: Use the provided `schema.sql` file to set up the database structure.
2. **Seed the Database**: Run the following command to populate the database with sample data:
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```
3. **Start the Server**: Start the back-end server with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. **API Testing**: Use [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or a similar tool to test API routes. You can use:
   - `GET` routes to retrieve all products, categories, or tags, or filter by ID.
   - `POST` routes to create new entries.
   - `PUT` routes to update existing entries.
   - `DELETE` routes to remove entries by ID.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the application.
- **Express.js**: Web framework to structure the server and API.
- **Sequelize ORM**: Maps data to models for easier interaction with the database.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database system for data storage and retrieval.
